            <h3>What Occupies My Personal Time?</h3>
            <p>
                I am a devoted husband, proud father, avid snowboarder, decent homebrewer, semi-regular traveler...
                I also enjoy camping, playing with my dogs, river rafting, watching football (go 'Hawks!) and baseball (c'mon M's!).<br/>
                When people ask me what I've been up to, I generally struggle to identify specifically what I have been spending my time doing.
                But more often than not, it probably falls into one or more of these things. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Husband</b> I first met my beautiful wife in 2008 (ask me about the story about how she "fell" for me). 
                    In 2012, I proposed to her at one of the Seven Wonders of the World: Machu Picchu. 
                    In 2016, we brought our amazing daugther into the world (see below). And all along it's been an amazing adventure
                    with my partner at my side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Father</b> My friends with kids always told me that being a parent will change you in the best way possible.
                    I never put much weight into that statement until May 2016 when my daughter was born. Being a dad is so much
                    more of a rewarding experience than I ever could have imagined. I love watching her grow and learn, I just 
                    wish she would stop growing so quickly!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Snowboarder</b> I've been snowboarding for about 18 years. You might think that makes me a really good
                    snowboarder, but it really doesn't. Regardless, I love being on the mountain and the serenity that the landscape offers.
                    I've done numerous snow-cat backcountry trips and a couple things on my snowboarding bucket list are a heli trip and snowboarding
                    somewhere other than North America (Chile, Japan, etc). Let me know if you're headed to a local hill
                    and want some company!&nbsp;
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">(I'm friends with skiers too!&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>)</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Homebrewer</b> I <i style="color: red;" class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i> beer. Craft beer specifically. 
                    One day, my loving wife grew tired of hearing me <em>talk</em> about how I should try brewing beer and bought me a
                    beginner's homebrew kit setup as a gift. Those first few batches weren't very good (thanks for being good sports, 
                    friends / guinea pigs that suffered through the early brews!), but the seed was planted, and a homebrewer was born. 
                    Stop by the house and I'll pour you a nice cold one from our kegerator!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Traveler</b> I love travelling, regardless of if it's a quick trip to Arizona in March to watch the Mariners at Spring Training, 
                    or flying down to Peru to visit the country where I was born and where my dad lives. I haven't travelled the world as
                    extensively as some (yet), but in no particular order, some of the countries I've travelled to are:
                    Australia, Canada, Jamaica, Mexico, Netherlands (coming soon!), and Peru. Ok, that's alphabetical order.
